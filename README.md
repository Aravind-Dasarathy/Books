# Books
## Simple Custom Install Page:

The goal fo this app is to demonstrate how to use the custom install page to do two things that are not possible with the iparam.json 
The first is to use new form elements. The custom install page should have a parameter called "Background color". This brings us a color picker. The (sample your first app's) bgcolor can use this iparam to set the color accordingly.
The second is to have a set of radio buttons that are dynamically generated. To do this hit this API - https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books and list the book name as the display label. The selected text can be displayed in the app.
